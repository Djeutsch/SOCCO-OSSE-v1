# SOCCO-OSSE-v1


A series of semi-idealized observing system simulation experiments (OSSEs) performed in (Djeutchouang et al. (2022))(https://doi.org/10.5194/bg-2021-344) to test the sensitivity of surface ocean 𝒑𝐂𝐎𝟐 reconstructions to spatial and temporal sampling scales.


The OSSE dataset for assessing the sensitivity of 𝒑𝐂𝐎𝟐 reconstructions to sampling scales across a Southern Ocean sub-domain can be found on Zenodo
